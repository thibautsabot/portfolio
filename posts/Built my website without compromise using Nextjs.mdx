Rich Harris the creator of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
(who recently [joined Vercel](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1458822051263823875)) [made a talk about "Transition App"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=860d8usGC0o)
called "Have Single-Page Apps Ruined the Web?".

In his talk, he presents the benefits and downsides of MPA (Multi Page Application) and SPA (Single Page Application)
and states that the Web is not binary and that the best of both worlds is possible.
The sweet spot lies between the two and frameworks are constantly improving.

And I couldn't agree more! Actually, I strongly believe that [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is the perfect framework to achieve that.

By providing ways to do Client Side Rendering (CSR), Server Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
you have complete control on how your page should be rendered!

Take this blog / portfolio as an example.

There is a million different ways to build it, from an old-school vanilla MPA to a classic SPA with React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, ...

The truth is that each page is different and have different requirements.

Here a quick summary of the technical choices I made for my website's pages:

<br />

### Homepage

The [Homepage](/) uses [ISR](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/next.js/incremental-static-regeneration) because this is the main entry to my website.

I want this page to be as fast as possible!

I don't want to wait for JavaScript to load. I don't want to wait for my server to generate the page on demand.

Having a static page to be rendered as fast as possible is a must!

The homepage contains my "recent activities" that are fetched through API calls that will change over time.
ISR allows me to serve a static page but to keep my activities relatively up to date as it'll regenerate the page every minute or so.

This data fetching method is truly amazing as I can have a very fast response time with almost up to date informations!

### Twitter page

The [twitter](/twitter) page contains my latest tweets and retweets.

For this page I chose to render it via SSR!

There are two main reasons for this choice.
First of all, I want this page to always be up-to-date. Unlike the Homepage, if you land here, you need to have the most recent tweets,
otherwise this page lose half of its interest.

SSG is a no go and ISR wouldn't cut it since you have a non-negligible chance of seeing a stale page (unless the `regenerate` option is very very low).

By using SSR, I'm making sure that the server will always make the call to the Twitter API on every visit, thus serving the latest tweets.

The second reason why I chose SSR is because the Twitter API in authenticated and I don't want to:

- Leak my personal access token
- Make the user login to see my tweets
- Risk having issues with permission rights

By making the calls server-side, I'm making sure that the token is safe and that only my provider (Vercel) can use it.

### GitHub page

[This page](/github) shows all of my activities from PR, commits, branches, discussions, ...

Like the Twitter page, I want this one to show always up-to-date information.

For this one I chose the infamous Client Side Rendering, but let me explain why.

On this page, there are multiples API calls, one for each section.

Even if network calls on the server are, in theory, much faster on average than on a user's browser,
you still need for all of them to complete before rendering the page when using Server Side Rendering.

The GitHub API can be quite slow and I don't want to make the user wait to see something.

By rendering the static skeleton of my page I can quickly show a loading indicator to my users, notifying them than something is happening.

Then I can make the API calls on the client and display the information as they come.

It's not perfect since I'm rendering loading indicators for each section, but it's still better than a blank and sad page, don't you think?

To keep this up-to-date and more responsive during navigation, I'm using [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/).

> SWR is a strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data.
> With SWR, components will get a stream of data updates constantly and automatically.
> And the UI will be always fast and reactive.

### Blog articles

The [blogs pages](/blog) are the one you are reading right now, they are stored in local `.mdx` files.

For my blogs, I'm using SSG to render them as plain HTML since they don't have any kind of interaction besides links.

Because I don't have a lot of posts, building them is quite fast and I don't mind waiting a few seconds on each build to update them all.

If you have a lot of articles, you can leverage `getStaticPaths` to only render the first X articles
and provides any kind of [fallback](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#the-fallback-key-required) for the others.

As you can see every page uses a different fetching method depending on its need.

We are far from the "all MPA" or all "SPA model"! You can offer an amazing user experience by adding the benefits of
Single Page Application but still be as fast as a more traditional MPA.

Some people say that we killed the Web by trying to add more "tech" to it.

**In my opinion, we are in a golden era for the Web, and we are just starting!!**

By the way, Next.js is always improving. For example, there have been some experimentation about [disabling runtime JS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/11949) for certain pages,
load third party scripts in [web workers](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/31517), ...

But the most hyped experimental features are probably [SSR Streaming and Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/react-18)!
